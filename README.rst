inesonic-speedsentry
====================
This is the original WordPress plugin to be used by SpeedSentry customers and
allowed customers to monitor their site's activity directly in the WordPress
admin panel.

The plugin includes a mostly automatic system that was used by SpeedSentry to
obtain a per-customer shared secret used to authenticate requests for customer
site activity and latency data.

Note that version 1e, now named 1.5, was the first production release.
